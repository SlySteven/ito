			<div class="panel-body">
				<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/327778/ito" target="_blank">Ito</a> is a cooperative party game for 2-8 players, that takes about 5 minutes per round.</p>
				<p>One player should place their phone in the center of the table, so everyone can see the category. You don't need any other phones.</p> 
				<p>Each player takes two cubes of the same color. Ignore the cylinder. Place the yellow 0 card in the center of the table. Deal each player 1 card, which has a number from 1 to 100. Look at it secretly, but don't show or say the number!</p>
				<p><strong>You all win if you can arrange your cards in ascending order</strong>. But the only way to communicate is by giving examples of the category above, where 1 means "least relevant/popular" and 100 means "most relevant/popular". For instance, if the category is "Big Animals", if you have a 6 you might say "butterfly" while if you have a 90 you might say "whale". You can change your answers at any time.</p>
				<p>Players place their cards face-down in ascending order, to the right of the 0 card. Keep one colored cube in front of you and put the other on your card, so players remember whose is whose. You can rearrange at any time.</p>
				<p>When players agree on the order, start revealing the cards from left (by the 0) to right, to see if you got them all in ascending order. We could make up a point scheme, but the points don't really matter.</p>

				<h3 class="panel-title" id="p1-title">Leveling up</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>Once you've beaten the base game perfectly, you can start a harder game by ignoring the cubes and dealing an additional card to 1 or 2 players. You can continue increasing the difficulty by giving <em>everyone</em> 1 additional card, or 2, or 3!</p>

			</div>
			<div class="panel-body">
				<p>To play with 9+ players, deal out 1 card per player as usual but ignore the cubes since there aren't enough. Instead of laying out all cards before flipping, players can reveal their cards at any time and add them next to the 0, trying to reveal them all in ascending order.</p>
